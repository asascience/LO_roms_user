# README for LO_roms_user

### This repo is a place for user versions of ROMS code associated with the svn repository LO_roms_source.

### Biology
This is a folder containing the custom NPZDOC code developed by Banas, Davis, and Siedlecki. The programs were copied directly from LiveOcean_roms/LO_ROMS/ROMS/Nonlinear/Biology and then renamed to "fennel_" in the hope that they could then be used by defining BIO_FENNEL and without changing other parts of the ROMS source code.
